# Events

The `Graph` instance is a node.js-like event emitter. As such, you can listen to its events in order to be able to react. This is particularly useful if you need to render your graph or maintain external indexes.

Documentation about node.js event emitters can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html).

Here is the list of the events you can listen:

## nodeAdded

## edgeAdded

## nodeDropped

## edgeDropped

## cleared

## nodeUpdated

## edgeUpdated
