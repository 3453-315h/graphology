# Discussion

* Discuss awkward currying of some attribute-related methods?
* Make the graph Directed by default?

* [NO] Decide whether providing inexisting nodes to the edge-adding method should throw or create the nodes. (prÃ©voir options?)
* [NO] edge iterators -> commonEdge for intersection?
* [NO] neighbor iterators -> commonNeighbor for intersection?


## ToDo

* Collapsible menu (with collapse all?)
* Add full TOC?
* Precise the alternative constructor
