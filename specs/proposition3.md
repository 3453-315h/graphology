# API Specs Proposition nÂ°3

## Objectives

Build a specification for a `Graph` object in JavaScript that could serve as a basis for any typical use cases going from graph generation, algorithms (on fairly huge graphs even but never for graphs too big that they would pose memory issues) and even graph rendering.

The idea is to propose a specification with the attached unit tests but not to enforce a particular implementation (even if we'll of course propose one of our own along with a series of relevant modules).

## Rationale

To ensure that one may perform every graph-related task with the library, we should aim to abide by the following principle: Graphs being complex objects whose definition is sometimes different according to the use cases and the domains, one should be, by default, be able to do anything with the default graph object provided by the library. This means that:

1. The default graph should accept every case from undirectedness to parallel edges etc.
2. Contrary to other libraries that would have a default graph covering only most basic cases and complexifying the graph object and APIs when one wants to perform stranger things, our library should by default cover the whole complexity while letting the user provide hints concerning the structure of the graph as means for the underlying implementation to enhance performance.

This approach comes with some advantages:

* The basic graph will handle every case & never will an algorithm fail to process the provided graph because of its specificities (except of course if the algorithm tends to apply only to one specific type of graph).
* The handled graph object is **always** the same and one doesn't need to learn more than one API to use it.

but also with some quirks:

* the API is compulsorily more verbose (but note that this spec only proposes a "low-level" object that could be associated with other higher-level wrapper libraries for easier handling).

### Facets

Facets are the multiple criteria that one could provide as performance hints to the implementation:

* **Directedness**: Is the graph allowing `directed` edges, `undirected` edges or both?
* **Multi**: Does the graph allow parallel edges?
* **Map**: Should the graph accept references as keys?
* **?Mutable**: Should the graph be mutable or not (tmtc @DavidBruant) (outside of the standard spec)

The default `Graph` object is therefore be an observable, mutable, mixed multi graph allowing self links.

Then the user would be able to hint about the structure of the graph using the constructor or relying on some handy shortcuts.

```ts
const graph = new Graph();
const graph = new Graph(null, {type: 'directed'});
const graph = new DirectedGraph();
const graph = new MultiDirectedGraph();
const graph = new ImmutableGraph();
//...
```

## Structure

The graph holds **nodes** and **edges** both being represented by a key and respectively storing attributes.

```ts
(node): key => attributes
(edge): key + [sourceKey, targetKey] => attributes
```

Like a JS `Map`, nodes & edges' keys can be anything, even references.

**Concerning bunches**

As in networkx, some methods can read from various iterables understood as node & edges bunches.

As a general rule, if the iterable is list-like (Array, Set), the values will be understood as keys. Whereas, if the iterable is key-value-like (Object, Map), then, the keys will be understood as keys and the values as attributes.

### Instantiation

```ts
const graph = new Graph(data, options);
```

The input data may only be the following or another graph instance.

```ts
interface SerializedNode<any> {
  0: any;    // Key
  1: Object; // Attributes
}

interface SerializedEdge<any> {
  0: any;    // Key
  1: any;    // Source
  2: any;    // Target
  3: Object; // Attributes
  4: boolean // Is directed?
}

interface SerializedGraph {
  nodes: Array<SerializedNode>;
  edges: Array<SerializedEdge>;
}
```

#### Options

* *allowSelfLoops* `boolean` [`true`]: Should the graph accept self loops?
* *indexes* `object`: Handling the index' configuration (lazyness, precomputation etc.)
* *type* `string` [`mixed`]: Type of the graph. One of `directed`, `undirected` or `mixed`.
* *map* `boolean` [`false`]: Should the graph accept references as keys like a `Map`?
* *multi* `boolean` [`true`]: Should the graph accept parallel edges.
* *edgeIdGenerator* `function`: Function the graph will use to generate edges' added through the #.addSingleEdge method (probably using uuid v4 compressed through base64 or base91).
* *hashDelimiter* `string`: String delimiter used to compose string hashes when required.

#### Facet naming

### Mutations

#### #.addNode

Adds a single node to the graph.

### Iteration

Iteration methods should assume the following stances:

* `forEach` iterators (optionally combined with other typical reducers).
* Generators.
* Array-giving methods.
* Counting methods.

Iteration targets are:

* Nodes
* Edges
* A node or bunch of nodes' neighbors
* A node or bunch of nodes' edges

Iterations methods always only give access to nodes' & edges' keys and not attributes. The getter methods should be used to retrieve attributes during iteration.

#### Nodes

```
#.nodes()
#.forEachNode()
#.createNodeIterator()
#.order
```

#### Edges

```
#.edges()
#.forEachEdge()
#.createEdgeIterator()
#.size

#.inEdges()
#.inboundEdges()
#.countInEdges()
...
#.outEdges()
#.outboundEdges()
...
#.undirectedEdges()
...
#.directedEdges()
...
```

#### Neighbours

```
#.neighbors()
#.forEachNeighbor()
#.createNeighborIterator()
#.countNeighbors()

#.inNeighbors()
#.inboundNeighbors()
...
#.outNeighbors()
#.outboundNeighbors()
...
```

### Events

The `Graph`Â class should be an event emitter that one can listen. We should probably stick to the [node](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) event module to do so.

#### addNode

```ts
graph.on('addNode', (key: any));
```

#### addEdge

```ts
graph.on('addEdge', (key: any, source: any, target: any));
```

#### dropNode

```ts
graph.on('dropNode', (key: any));
```

#### dropEdge

```ts
graph.on('dropEdge', (key: any, source: any, target: any));
```

#### clear

```ts
graph.on('clear', ());
```

#### setNodeAttribute

```ts
graph.on('setNodeAttribute', (key: any, name: string, value: any));
```

#### setEdgeAttribute

```ts
graph.on('setEdgeAttribute', (key: any, name: string, value: any));
```

### Utilities

#### #.toString

Used by JavaScript for string coercion.

```ts
const stringRepresentation: string = graph.toString();
```

Should return something useful such as:

```js
'Graph<14 nodes, 45 edges>'
```

#### #.toJSON

Should return a serialized version of the graph.

Used by JavaScript when using `JSON.stringify`.

```ts
const serializedGraph: Object = graph.toJSON();
```

Following the methods one could use to serialize an ES6 Map ([reference nÂ°1](http://www.2ality.com/2015/08/es6-map-json.html), [reference nÂ°2](https://github.com/DavidBruant/Map-Set.prototype.toJSON)):

####Â #.inspect

Should return an overview of the graph as a string.

Used by node to display objects when printing them through the console.

```ts
const inspected: string = graph.inspect();
```
